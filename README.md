# Python Practise 
In this folder/ repo I will be practising what I am learning in order to understand how Python works and how to code using Python Language. My main focus is to have a deeper understanding of how control flow statements and functions works to be able to deliver my notes-taking application.

# Types of data in Python
INT: Whole numbers
FLOAT: Decimal Numbers
STRING: set of letters, special characters, symbols and even numbers if they are placed between double quotation.
BOOLEAN: Data type that can only have a TRUE or False value, often used with comparisons operands, logical operators.

# Operators

## Comparison Operators 
- Compare two operands and results in boolean value.
== Equality operator 
> Greater than operator 
< Less than operator 
>= Greater than or equals operator
<= Less than or equals operator

## Assignment operators 
- Used to assign values to variables
=	a = 10	a = 10
+=	a += 30	a = a + 30
-=	a -= 15	a = a - 15


# Flow statements
    - Control the flow of the program using flow statements:
    - IF, ELIF and ELSE (Command gets executed once one of the statements becomes TRUE)
    - FOR interacts with each item in the sequence in the order they appear in the sequence. The sequence can be string, list, tuple or range. FOR executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.

    - WHILE (While condition is true, keep executing this line of code)
    - MATCH-CASE 
    - RANGE() is commonly used with FOR, it iterates over a item in a range. It can also return items in a list if needed using list() function. It can be used with (start, stop, step) or only (stop). 
    - PASS (Does nothing)
    - BREAK (Exit the program)
